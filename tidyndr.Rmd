## HIV/AIDS - the global pandemic

.pull-left[
`r icons::fontawesome("ribbon")` - First case of HIV was detected 40 years ago  

In 2020:

`r icons::ionicons("man")` - 1.5 million new infections   

`r icons::fontawesome("ambulance")` - 690 thousand people died of AIDS-related                                           illnesses

`r icons::ionicons("people")` - 37.6 million people were living with HIV/AIDS  

`r icons::fontawesome("pills")` `r icons::fontawesome("universal-access")` - equitable access remains a challenge.

- Forty years have passed since the first case of HIV/AIDS. Yet, in the year 2020, 1.5 million people were newly infected with the virus

- 690 thousand people died of AIDS-related illnesses; 37.6 million people were living with HIV/AIDS.

- While remarkable progress has been recorded in the last decade, inequity between and within countries continues to drive the epidemic. Though some countries have attained epidemic control, many are off-track with COVID-19, conflict, and humanitarian emergencies reversing the gains.
- The UNAIDS has set ambitious targets to achieve epidemic control of HIV/AIDS by 2030 through identification of at least 95% of persons living with virus, retaining 95% of those identified on treatment and achieving viral suppression in at least 95% of those on treatment.

## Nigeria

.pull-left[
- Estimated 1.9 million people living with HIV.

- In the year 2020:
    
    - 73% of people living with HIV had been diagnosed

    - 89% of those diagnosed were accessing treatment

    - 78% of those accessing treatment were virally suppressed.
    
- Need for data utilization at every level

???

- Nigeria has the fourth-largest epidemic in the world with an estimated 1.9 million people living with HIV. 

- At the end of 2020, the progress across the three 95s are: 73%-89%- and-78% with varying prevalence and progress across the states as shown by the map

- To achieve the UNAIDS target, granular data at community, local government and sub-population levels must continuously be made available and utilized for informed decision.

## The National Data Repository - NDR

- A repository of de-identified patient-level data from facilities across all the states in the country

- Contains records of over 2000 reporting facilities and over 1.3 million PLHIV currently on treatment.

- Restricted access [A public dashboard is available](https://ndr.shieldnigeriaproject.com/public/dashboard).

- In 2016, through the PEPFAR support, the journey to a National (HIV) Data Repository started. The repository contains the de-identified records of over 1.3 million HIV clients on treatment across the country. 

- This is accessible to persons within the industry to track progress and improve programming at various levels. Linelist of these clients can be downloaded for further analysis and use. 

- The pictures below show snapshot of the NDR public dashboard

According to the PEPFAR MER version 2.5,

"It is essential to not only capture high-quality data, but to also continuously use and analyze the data to achieve maximum program impact.The only way to improve data is to use the data”

## NDR data use

Analysis is traditionally conducted using spreadsheets. Challenges include:

+   The software must be installed on the user’s computer.

+   The user must be familiar with the formula for calculation of the indicator of interest.

+   Can be quite heavy and difficult to manipulate

+   It is error-prone. Sometimes these errors go unnoticed

+   Periodic analysis can be quite tedious and time-consuming



???

- However, analysis of the downloaded data is traditionally conducted in spreadsheet applications. 

- While these provide a great platform, the downsides include: the software must be installed on the user’s computer, and the user must be familiar with the formula for the calculation. The point-and-click nature makes it error-prone, with difficult reproducibility. Also, performing the same analysis periodically can be quite tedious and time-consuming

- A cross-functional team of 7 clinical and data experts came together to put together the {tidyndr} package to support analysis of the NDR patient linelist.

The package is designed in line with the data science workflow proposed by Hadley Wickham. Varying functions are responsible for importing, tidying, transforming, and summarizing the analysis.

Nine tidyverse and tidyverse-related packages were used in the development of the package.

## The package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# from CRAN
install.packages("tidyndr", dependencies = TRUE)

# developmental version from github
devtools::install_github("stephenbalogun/tidyndr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

<br/>

.pull-left[
#### Importing function

```
read_ndr()
```
#### Treatment function

```
1. tx_new()
2. tx_curr()
3. tx_appointment()
4. tx_ml()
5. tx_ml_outcomes()
6. tx_rtt()
7. tx_mmd()
```
]

.pull-right[

#### Viral Load functions

```
1. tx_vl_eligible()
2. tx_pvls_den()
3. tx_pvls_num()
4. tx_vl_unsuppressed()
```
#### Summary functions

```
1. summarise_ndr()
2. disaggregate()
```
]


???

- tidyndr can be installed from both github and CRAN

- where possible, the functions are named similar to the PEPFAR program indicators that users are already familiar with

- these functions are grouped into 1 importing function, 7 treatment-related functions, 4 viral load-related functions and 2 summary functions.
